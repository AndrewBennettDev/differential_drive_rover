# Arduino Differential Drive Rover

### Description
This repo holds a very basic setup for using an Arduino Nano, Arduino Uno with L298N motor driver, or Aruidno Uno with motor hat to 
steer two motors (differential drive) based on input from an ultrasonic sensor. At the bottom of the main file you will find comments 
about which inputs to use depending on which variation you need. There will occasionally be new methods adding for controlling other fun
things (lights, touch sensors, etc) but it should be easy to use or ignore these methods as needed.

### Usage
This one is nice and simple! Clone the repo, open the file in the Arduino IDE or your favorite alternative, plug in your board, and send 
the file! You will need to have the ultrasonic sensor and motors connected properly, but other than that it's plug and play.
